Class Component has its own lifecycle :

Function component has no such lifecylce 
In functional component we can not use lifecycle methods.
In functional component we use Hooks instead of lifecycle methods to work.


Class Component works in 3 states through out its lifecycle :

state 1 :  initialisation state / mounting state

state 2  : updating state

state 3 :  unloading state / unmounting state


Functions associated with lifecycle :

Component class initialises :

constructor() is called

componentWillMount() ----> this function is called before render()

render()  is called ---->  mounting state

componentDidMount() ---->last function of mounting state

updating state :

componentShouldUpdate() ----> boolean type of function which return true or false
                              By default this function alwways returns true.
                              If this function returns false then we will not be able
                              to update our state.							  

componentWillUpdate() -----> update is done using setState() state update 

render() ----> is called automatically

componentDidUpdate() ----> Last function called in updating state

unmounting state :

componentWillUnmount() ---> this function is called when we unmount / unload the 
                            component.
